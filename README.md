1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their game, Draw It or Lose it, into a web-based multi-platform environment.
    Their requirements included support for all major platforms, Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   
    I felt that I did well analyzing the platforms and recommending appropriate solutions.
    I described why using Windows Server for hosting due to its strong compatibility with development tools, cross-platform support, and enterprise-grade features.
    I also clearly explained how cloud-based storage and memory management techniques would allow for scalability and smooth gameplay. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   
    Working through the design document helped me break down the project into manageable sections, operating platform, architecture, memory, storage, distributed systems, and security.
    This made it easier to connect technical choices to specific client needs, like why cloud storage solved cross-platform access or how RESTful APIs enabled communication between clients and servers. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   
    I would revise the comparison section that evaluated Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile platforms.
    My original comparison provided useful technical distinctions.
    In the revision I would focus more directly on the client’s requirements to ensure each evaluation tied back to their specific needs for Draw It or Lose It.
    This would make the analysis more concise and also more client-centered, strengthening the rationale for my final recommendation.
   
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    I interpreted the user’s needs by prioritizing cross-platform compatibility and reliable data access.
    To meet this, I recommended cloud-based storage that uses a single API for all assets, so that Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile clients can access the same images, player profiles, and game states without requiring
    separate storage solutions for each platform.
    This design choice simplifies expansion to new environments while maintaining consistent performance.
    Considering user needs is important because it ensures the software remains both scalable and accessible across all platforms, delivering consistent experience for every player.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    
    I approached the design by using a requirements-driven strategy, breaking down the client’s goals, mapping them to software architecture principles, and recommending technologies to satisfy them.
    I also used comparative evaluation to justify recommendations.
    This strategy proved effective because it kept the design aligned with both technical feasibility and client needs.
    In the future, I would continue using this structured approach since it ensures decisions are well-documented, justified, and scalable for similar software projects.
